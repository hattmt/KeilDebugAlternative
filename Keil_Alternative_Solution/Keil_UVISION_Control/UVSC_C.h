  * @brief UVSOCK Client DLL Interface
  * @version V2.28
  *
  * API for the UVSC DLL, to facilitate 3rd party application communication with 
  * uVision.
  *
  * <b>General API Rules</b>
  *
  * @li All 'reserved' data fields must be written as 0 and ignored when reading.
  * @li Non-relevant data fields in requests must be written as 0.
  * @li The UVSC DLL must be loaded from the installed UV3 folder to guarantee compatibility with
  *     UV3.exe. The UVSC DLL must not be included in your distributed application, unless your application
  *     is guaranteed to be used only with the specific version of KEIL tools from which the UVSC DLL   
  *     was taken.

  * <b>Change Log</b>
  *
  * Version 2.02:
  * @li initial release
  * @li version in line with UVSOCK interface
  *
  * Version 2.03:
  * @li Additional error codes (UVSC_STATUS_INVALID_CONTEXT, UVSC_STATUS_INVALID_PARAM, 
  *                             UVSC_STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, UVSC_STATUS_CALLBACK_IN_USE, 
  *                             UVSC_STATUS_COMMAND_ERROR)
  * @li Build and progress bar callbacks added (UVSC_CB_BUILD_OUTPUT_MSG, UVSC_CB_PROGRESS_BAR_MSG)
  *
  * Version 2.04:
  * @li Bug fix:     Increased size of internal message queue to 200
  * @li Bug fix:     Removed buffer overrun from UVSC logging
  * @li Enhancement: Logging completely disabled when NULL passed to both logFileName and
  *                  logCallback in UVSC_OpenConnection
  *
  * Version 2.05:
  * @li Bug fix:     Replaced bool type with xBOOL, as bool is C++ only type. API is still 
  *                  binary compatible.
  *
  * Version 2.06:
  * @li Enhancement: Modified Message Box blocking mechanism, reducing the amount of messages 
  *                  required to complete several commands
  * @li Baseline:    Backwards compatibility for UVSC_C.h API from this version
  *
  * Version 2.07:
  * @li Bug Fix:     Timeouts changed (Message Response = 10 seconds, Async Response = 3 minutes)
  * @li Bug Fix:     Removed occasional deadlock in UVSC_DBG_EXIT()
  * @li Bug Fix:     Calling UVSC_LogControl() no longer returns an error if logging is not enabled
  *
  * Version 2.08:
  * @li Enhancement: Added UV_DBG_EXEC_CMD command. It allows any command line to be executed via UVSOCK
  * @li Enhancement: Added UV_PRG_GET_OUTPUTNAME command. It allows the current executable name to be retrieved
  *
  * Version 2.09:
  * @li Enhancement: Changed display of Breakpoint-command responses to show BP_DELETED, BP_ENABLED etc.
  *                  This requires to look at 'cmdRsp.status' for exact Bp-action.
  *
  * Version 2.10:
  * @li Enhancement: Added #UVSC_PSTAMP, #UV_DBG_POWERSCALE_SHOWCODE, #UV_DBG_POWERSCALE_SHOWPOWER, #UVSC_POWERSCALE_SHOWCODE

  *
  * Version 2.17:
  * @li Enhancement: Added #UV_DBG_EVAL_WATCH_EXPRESSION, #UV_DBG_REMOVE_WATCH_EXPRESSION
  *                        #UV_DBG_ENUM_VARIABLES,  #UV_DBG_VARIABLE_SET
  *                  to support Eclipse client

  *        via the #UVSC_ConnHandleFromConnName function. If a connection name is not
  *        required this parameter should be NULL
  * @param iConnHandle Pointer to a variable to contain the handle assigned to this connection.
  *        The value assigned will be invalid if the function returns an error. This 
  *        pointer must not be NULL
  * @param pPort Pointer to a variable containing the port of an existing uVision session 
  *        to connect, or the value #UVSC_PORT_AUTO to auto-start a uVision session for 
  *        this connection. If the function returns successfully, this variable will contain 
  *        the port that was used for the connection. This pointer must not be NULL.
  * @param uvCmd Pointer to a zero terminated string containing the path to a uVision
  *        executable to be started automatically for this connection. If 
  *        uVision is not being auto-started this parameter is ignored and should be
  *        NULL
  * @param uvRunmode Indicates the mode uVision should be started in when
  *        auto-started. If uVision is not being auto-started this parameter is ignored
  * @param callback Pointer to a function to receive callbacks from UVSC. The callbacks
  *        provide notification of asynchronous UVSOCK messages, connection events,
  *        and errors relating to the connection. NOTE: UVSC_xxx API functions must
  *        not be called from the callback. To call a UVSC_xxx function in response to the
  *        callback, a notification must be passed another thread, which can then call the
  *        UVSC_xxx function.
  * @param cb_custom This pointer will be returned in the calls to the callback function.
  *        It may be used for any purpose, but a common usage is for keeping track of the
  *        'this' pointer of a C++ object relating to the connection
  * @param logFileName Pointer to a zero terminated string containing the path to a 
  *        file to use for logging UVSOCK messages for this connection for debug
  *        purposes. If a debugging log file is not required, this parameter should be NULL
  * @param logFileAppend Pass 'xTRUE' to append to the log file specified in @a logFileName,
  *        or 'xFALSE' to overwrite the file. If @a logFileName is NULL, this parameter is
  *        ignored
  * @param logCallback Pointer to a function to receive logging callbacks. These
  *        callbacks contain the same information that is entered into the log file.
  *        If this callback is not required, this parameter should be NULL
  * @return #UVSC_STATUS_SUCCESS on success, or an error code
  *
  * @pre #UVSC_Init must have been called successfully
  *
  * This function opens a connection to a uVision session. The session can be either an existing
  * session, or UVSC can automatically start a new session.
  *
  * <b>To auto-start a new uVision session (recommended):</b>
  *
  * @li @a pPort must be #UVSC_PORT_AUTO
  * @li @a uvCmd must be the path to a valid uVision executable that supports UVSOCK
  *
  * Auto-starting uVision has the following advantages:
  *
  * @li uVision is in a known state from the beginning of the connection
  * @li uVision can be started in a special mode, that restricts how a user can
  *     interact with the remotely controlled session
  * @li If the uVision session is terminated by an application other than UVSC,
  *     UVSC automatically restarts the uVision session
  * @li uVision starts hidden from the user, and can remain that way for the whole
  *     session, operating silently in the background, if necessary
  * @li The uVision session is a sub-process of UVSC, and can therefore be reliably
  *     terminated by UVSC when the connection is closed
  *
  * <b>To connect to an exisiting uVision session (not recommended):</b>
  * 
  * @li @a pPort must be the UVSOCK port number of the existing uVision session
  * @li @a uvCmd must be NULL
